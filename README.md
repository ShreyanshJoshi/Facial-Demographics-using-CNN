## Overview
The basic goal of the project was to predict the age and gender of a person, given his/her facial image using Convolutional Neural Network. Both the models were trained on top of **Keras API** (which is in turn built on top of Tensorflow) and finally deployed in **Flask**.

**Note: For training purposes, I made use of Tesla K80 GPU available for free on Google Colab.**

This project includes 2 seperate tasks  -
* **Age & Gender Classification** - This model classifies ages into 5 categories: 0-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99, 100-124 and gender into 2 categories: male, female. The model was trained on *UTKFace* dataset (23,708 images) and attained a validation accuracy of 0.8279 and 0.9502 on age and gender classification respectively.

* **Age Estimation** - This was a regression task. The model was trained on *WIKIFace* dataset (34,200 images). The model attained a validation mae of 6.55 which shows the average magnitude of error in predicting age.

## Motivation
I created this end-to-end project in my 6 week internship at **Silver Touch Technologies Ltd.**, which was held under PS1 program of BITS Pilani. We were a team of 4 members and everyone was assigned to work on different approaches to tackle this problem. I was assigned to create a CNN from scratch. Special thanks to the entire SilverTouch team for providing this wonderful opportunity to me.  

## Technical Details
For detailed analysis, please refer to the report I have uploaded in this repository.


## To do
1. Add a face-detection algorithm such as Dlib, MTCNN so that user need not crop the image manually before uploading.
2. Deploy the model on a web server using AWS/Heroku so that it is available for use across the globe. Right now, it can only be hosted locally using Flask.

## Overview
The basic goal of the project was to predict the age and gender of a person, given his/her facial image using Convolutional Neural Network. Both the models were trained on top of **Keras API** (which is in turn built on top of Tensorflow) and finally deployed in **Flask**.

**Note: For training purposes, I made use of Tesla K80 GPU available for free on Google Colab.**

This project includes 2 seperate tasks  -
* **Age & Gender Classification** - This model classifies ages into 5 categories: 0-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99, 100-124 and gender into 2 categories: male, female. The model was trained on *UTKFace* dataset (23,708 images) and attained a validation accuracy of 0.8279 and 0.9502 on age and gender classification respectively.

* **Age Estimation** - This was a regression task. The model was trained on *WIKIFace* dataset (34,200 images). The model attained a validation mae of 6.55 which shows the average magnitude of error in predicting age.

## Motivation
I created this end-to-end project in my 6 week internship at **Silver Touch Technologies Ltd.** which was held under PS1 program of BITS Pilani. We were a team of 4 members and everyone was assigned to work on different approaches to tackle this problem. I was assigned to create a CNN from scratch. Special thanks to the entire SilverTouch team for providing this wonderful opportunity to me.

### Importance in real world
Recognizing a person is perhaps the most subconscious task done in our daily lives- right from waking up and recognizing our loved-ones to recognizing our boss at work. And the 2 most fundamental things required to identify someone are age & gender. With AI knocking on the door, no doubt this is one of the hottest fields in computer science these days. The goal of this project is to analyse the demographics of any population by just looking at their faces and predicting their age and gender. Here are some more real life applications of this project-
* **Embedding with IoT and making a real life solution.** A simple e.g - Fit a camera outside a bar/restaurant that clicks photos of people entering. When sufficient number of people have entered, run the model on their stored faces and get the average age and gender. Accordingly, play the music / change the lights by integrating IoT into the system.

* **Forensics** - To predict the age/gender of a dead person. This project can be extended to train on images of skeletons. In that case, it would be able to predict the age and gender of a person whose skeleton has been found. Perhaps even a skeleton belonging to the Stone Age !

* **Missing person identification** - Suppose we know someone has got lost in a neighborhood. The person filing the complaint, could feed the age and gender of the lost person into a machine. And assuming CCTV cameras are installed at each road junction, the model might filter out images of those people whose age and gender that it predicted matches with the inputted information. This might not solve the problem completely, but surely reduces the search space by a mile. 

## Technical Details
For detailed analysis, please refer to the report I have uploaded in this repository.


## To do
1. Add a face-detection algorithm such as Dlib, MTCNN so that user need not crop the image manually before uploading.
2. Deploy the model on a web server using AWS/Heroku so that it is available for use across the globe. Right now, it can only be hosted locally using Flask.
